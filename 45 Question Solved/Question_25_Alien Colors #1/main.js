// Question : 25
// Alien Colors #1: Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game. Create a variable called alien_color and assign it a value of 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'.
// • Write an if statement to test whether the alien’s color is green. If it is, print a message that the player just earned 5 points.
// • Write one version of this program that passes the if test and another that fails. (The version that fails will have no output.)

var AlienColor = "Red";
var PlayerName = " Zohan";
if (AlienColor === "Red") {
    console.log("An alien in Red color was  shot down in a game ".concat(PlayerName, " player earned 5 points."));
}
if (AlienColor === "Grey") {
    console.log("An alien in Grey color was  shot down in a game ".concat(PlayerName, " player earned 5 points."));
}
