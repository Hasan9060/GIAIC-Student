let Declarations:
In JavaScript, variables were traditionally declared using let. For example:
TypeScript

let a = 10;

However, var has some quirks, such as function-scoping and the ability to re-declare the same variable within the same scope.
let Declarations:
TypeScript introduced let as a more predictable alternative to var.
let has block-scoping, which means it is only accessible within the block where it is defined.
Example:
TypeScript

function f() {
    let message = "Hello, world!";
    return message;
}

const Declarations:
Use const when you want to declare a variable that should not be reassigned.
Example:
TypeScript

const pi = 3.14;

Global Variables:
To declare a global variable in TypeScript, you can use the declare global syntax. For instance:
TypeScript

// foo.ts
interface IData {
    test: string;
}
declare global {
    var someVar: IData;
}
