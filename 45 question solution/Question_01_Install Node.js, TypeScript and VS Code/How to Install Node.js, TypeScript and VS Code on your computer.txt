installing **Node.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** on your computer.

<b>## Installing Node.js:</b>
1. **Node.js** is a JavaScript runtime that allows you to run JavaScript code on the server side. It also includes **npm** (Node Package Manager) for managing packages and dependencies.
2. To install Node.js, follow these steps:
    - Visit the official Node.js website: [Node.js Downloads](https://nodejs.org/download/).
    - Choose the appropriate installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
    - Download and run the installer.
    - Follow the installation prompts to complete the setup.
3. To verify that Node.js is installed correctly, open a new terminal (command prompt) and type:
    ```
    node --version
    ```
    You should see the current Node.js version installed.

## Installing TypeScript:
1. **TypeScript** is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing and other features. It helps you write more maintainable and scalable code.
2. You can install TypeScript using either of the following methods:
    - **npm (Node Package Manager)**:
        - Open a terminal.
        - Run the following command to install TypeScript locally in your project:
          ```
          npm install typescript --save-dev
          ```
        - This ensures that everyone on your team uses the same TypeScript version.
        - To compile TypeScript files, use:
          ```
          npx tsc
          ```
    - **Visual Studio Code**:
        - If you're using Visual Studio Code, TypeScript support is built-in.
        - You can also install TypeScript globally using:
          ```
          npm install -g typescript
          ```
        - This allows you to use the `tsc` command anywhere in your terminal.

## Installing Visual Studio Code (VS Code):
1. **VS Code** is a powerful code editor with excellent support for JavaScript, TypeScript, and Node.js development.
2. To install VS Code:
    - Visit the [Visual Studio Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
    - Download the installer for your operating system.
    - Run the installer and follow the setup instructions.
3. Once installed, open VS Code and start coding!

Remember, these tools are essential for web development, and they'll make your coding experience more efficient and enjoyable. Happy coding! ðŸš€
